        "Built with TypeScript and designed with an architecture based on SOLID principles, this application uses React for the Front End and Node.js for the Back End. The design is fully responsive, implemented using Tailwind CSS. The main functionality involves retrieving products from a MongoDB database. The images associated with the products are stored in the cloud via Cloudinary, allowing the database to only store the corresponding URLs, organized by clothing categories. This approach optimizes the application's performance by reducing server load and improving content delivery efficiency.",
